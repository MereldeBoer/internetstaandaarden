              <img class="img-character" src="tour/dragon.JPG" alt="Sansa Stark">
              <p class="hover">The artists of the Sculpting Department carve and shape 
                            a wide array of materials including clay,glass,stone,plastic,metal and 
                            foam. Their creations range from full-size statues,props and architectural 
                            feautures to maquettes or models of creatures like dragons and direwolves - even 
                            the occasional giant dragon skull. The process begins with a sketch or illustration 
                            from the art Department that tthe sculptors the transform into an impressive 3D set piece.(Source: ''game of thrones studio tour:the offical guide'')

              <h2>Map Room</h2>
              <img class="img-character" src="tour/mapchamber.JPG" alt="Bran Stark">
              <p class="hover">The map table in the room is carved in clay. Working from a 
                            paper map the same size as the finished table, the props team 
                            traced it onto a large clay block,then sculpted it in full detail. 
                            it is 16.5ft/5m long and required 8-10 crew members to move. They 
                            created individuel letter stamps to incise names for every place, castle 
                            and tower in Westeros. Looking for a way to make landmarks more visible in 
                            the dim light,they used molten copper to mark roads,emeralds for trees, and other 
                            natural materials to highlight man-made structures like castles.(Source: ''game of thrones studio tour:the offical guide'')

              <p class="hover">The originally desighn of the map on the floor was 
                                done digitally on computer, then printed full-size,and finished 
                                in situ on the floor of the sound stage. The project took six weeks to complete. 
                                Jim Stanes can be seen in a cameo in season 7, appearing 
                                to paint the map before Cesrei dismisses him.(Source: ''game of thrones studio tour:the offical guide'' </p>
